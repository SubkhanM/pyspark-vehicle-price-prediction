# PySpark Vehicle Price Prediction Analysis  

## üìö Project Description  
This project involves analyzing and building a predictive model for vehicle prices using PySpark. The dataset includes various features such as vehicle specifications, mileage, and other attributes to predict the price of vehicles.  

The goal is to perform data analysis, preprocessing, and train a machine learning model to predict vehicle prices based on given attributes.  

## üìä Analysis Goals  
The project focuses on the following tasks :  

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**  
   - Identify missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Perform preprocessing to ensure data quality.  

2. **Feature Analysis**  
   - Explore relationships between different features and vehicle prices.  
   - Identify the most impactful features for prediction.  

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Train a regression model using PySpark MLlib.  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.  

4. **Predictions**  
   - Predict vehicle prices for new or unseen data using the trained model.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  
- **PySpark**: For data processing and machine learning.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive exploration and presenting the analysis.  
- **PySpark MLlib**: For model building and evaluation.  

## üìÅ Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Vehicle specifications (e.g., make, model, year).  
- Mileage, engine size, and other numerical features.  
- Price (target variable for prediction).  

If you need access to the dataset, please provide the required information or load it from a trusted source.
